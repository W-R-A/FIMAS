# Device Classes #
The object-orientated nature of C++ has been used to create a base class for all of the devices that are to be controlled. Each device has its own class which inherites from the base class. The device-specific classes implement the specific control signals and monitoring required to operate the device, while all device classes  have a consistant interface allowing for simple control from the rest of the system. 

To ensure that accurate timings are maintained, the change state function that is overwritten by child classes if necessary should return immediately after being called. If more time is needed for the control signals, a thread/timer should be signaled to complete this in an asynchronous manner.
